# KiCadProjects
Welcome to my KiCad project repository! I'm new to using KiCad and very excited to learn and explore this powerful tool for designing electronic schematics and printed circuit boards (PCBs). This repository will document my journey, showcase my projects, and hopefully serve as a helpful resource for others starting with KiCad.
